# Chat Buttons Begone!

This plugin is based on the work of [QbDesu](https://github.com/QbDesu)'s [RemoveChatButtons](https://github.com/BleedingBD/plugin-RemoveChatButtons) plugin.

This plugin allow you to hide all those annoying Chat Buttons that always bothered you. And much more!
Gift button? Begone! Sticker button? Begone!
But you can choose which buttons to hide and which to keep. Simply go to the plugin settings to customize it to your liking.

It doesn't stop at chat buttons though, it also adds the ability to hide various other annoying things around the app, such as the invite button on every channel, the Active Now section, voice panel buttons, any DM tabs such as the nitro tab, and much more!
